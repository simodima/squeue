## Key Features

### Driver-based Implementation
squeue abstracts the internal driver implementation through its interface, allowing for seamless integration of various drivers to suit different development environments and needs. 

Currently implemented drivers:
- In-Memory
- Amazon SQS

You can easily deploy the *Amazon SQS* driver in any staging or production environment and use the *In-Memory* driver for lightweight testing.

### Type Safety
The library uses an opinionated JSON format for serializing and deserializing messages. To achieve 100% type safety, simply provide a message type that implements the Golang `json.Marshaler` and `json.Unmarshaler` interfaces. This way, you maintain direct control over the raw data serialization and deserialization.

### Channel of Messages
Consuming messages is straightforwardâ€”just loop through a channel of messages:

```golang
messages, _ := sub.Consume(ctx, "queue")
for m := range messages {
    go func(message squeue.Message[*my.Message]) {
        // Do your magic...
    }(m)
}
```
